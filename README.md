I used Next.js to create this app. Then, I used Vercel to deploy it. I also used Tailwind CSS for the styling and Firebase for the server.

It is currently under development...

But here are some things I am planning on making:

- Create a projects tab (obviously ðŸ™„)
- Make UI better
- Add a love button connected to Firebase
