## Info
This is my portfolio: it hosts some of my projects and gives you an idea of who I am.

## Technology
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) web app. It uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling and [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) for deployment. 

## Version
This project is currently under development... The full version 1 will come out in June.

## Todo List
Here are some things I am planning on making: 
- Create a projects tab (obviously ðŸ™„)
- Make UI better
- Add a love button connected to Firebase

## Publish Information
This project was first published in late April. (I don't know the exact date...)
