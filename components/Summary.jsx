                        Cuboost was made for fun. It first all started with a game: <span className='text-teal-500'>"A cube that can boost!"</span>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Then, it evolved into something more than that: a <span className='text-teal-500'>helpful website</span> that can help with many things. You can flip a coin or check the time with my clock... It's all in one place!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And yes, no ads and completely free; just a <span className='text-teal-500'>helpful, safe, and fast</span> website.
                    </p>
                </div>
