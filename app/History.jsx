      <p>
        Cuboost was made for fun. It first all started with a game:{" "}
        <span className="text-teal-500">A cube that can boost!</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, it evolved into something more than that: a{" "}
        <span className="text-teal-500">helpful website</span> that can help
        with many things. You can flip a coin or check the time with my clock...
        It&apos;s all in one place!
      </p>
      <p>
        And yes, no ads and completely free; just a{" "}
        <span className="text-teal-500">helpful, safe, and fast</span> website.
      </p>
    </section>
